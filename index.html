I'm an engineer in the Machine Learning team at <a href="https://nuro.ai">Nuro</a>, working on autonomy for self-driving vehicles. I recently got my Masters from the <a href="http://ri.cmu.edu">Robotics Institute</a> at CMU, working under the supervision of Prof. Katia Sycara and working on multi-agent reinforcement learning. I have an undergraduate degree in Electrical Engineering from <a href="http://iitk.ac.in">IIT Kanpur</a>, India along with a minor in Artificial Intelligence. While doing my undergrad I co-founded Agilo Technologies and served as the CTO for 15 months, developing <a href="http://evive.cc">evive</a>, an educational hardware prototyping platform for students, and successfully <a href="http://igg.me/at/evive">crowdfunding</a> it on Indiegogo. Best way to get in touch is email.

<h2>Highlights</h2>

<ul>
<li> [Aug 2019] Started working at Nuro!
<li> [June 2019] Work on multi-agent learning presented at the ICML LRG workshop in Long Beach, USA [ <a href="https://graphreason.github.io/papers/29.pdf">paper</a> | <a href="https://github.com/sumitsk/marl_transfer">code</a> ]
<li> [May 2019] Defended my MS thesis on learning transferable cooperative behavior in multi-agent teams [ <a href="/assets/documents/ms_thesis.pdf">report</a> | <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vQxXxYbbk5PeAtutJw37dr-ZbjWY3vEnnPu0_vWES0lxO4dF5yaRjeLICEX09KYo2PqTUdgQcr1dP30/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=60000">slides</a> ]
<li> [Mar 2019] I will be joining <a href="https://nuro.ai">Nuro</a> as a Machine Learning Engineer, based out of Mountain View, CA, starting July! Nuro builds <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/31/nuros-self-driving-vehicle-is-a-grocery-getter-and-errand-runner/">these</a> self-driving vehicles for local B2C deliveries.

<li> Our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.02206">paper</a> on <a href="https://github.com/agakshat/spacefortress">Space Fortress</a> was presented at the AAAI-19 Workshop on Reinforcement Learning in Games in Hawaii, USA. </li></ul></li>
<li> [Sept 2018] Released 2 first-author preprints on arXiv:
  <ul>
    <li> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.09147">Better Safe than Sorry: Evidence Accumulation Allows for Safe Reinforcement Learning</a>.
    <li> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.02206">Challenges of Context and Time in Reinforcement Learning: Introducing Space Fortress as a Benchmark</a>. The <a href="https://github.com/agakshat/spacefortress">code</a> release includes an OpenAI Gym compatible RL environment, and baseline code!
  </ul>
