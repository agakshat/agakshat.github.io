I'm a Masters student in the <a href="http://ri.cmu.edu">Robotics Institute</a> at CMU, working under the supervision of Prof. Katia Sycara and looking at ways to improve how robots learn and adapt in the presence of other robots. I have an undergraduate degree in Electrical Engineering from <a href="http://iitk.ac.in">IIT Kanpur</a>, India along with a minor in Artificial Intelligence. While doing my undergrad I co-founded Agilo Technologies and served as the CTO for 15 months, developing <a href="http://evive.cc">evive</a>, an educational hardware prototyping platform for students, and successfully <a href="http://igg.me/at/evive">crowdfunding</a> it on Indiegogo. Best way to get in touch is email.
