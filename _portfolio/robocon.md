I was part of a team of 20 students who represented IIT Kanpur at ABU Robocon, a Pan-Asian college level student robotics competition. We built two co-dependent robots where the parent robot had to help the child robot navigate a playground, going through various tasks like climbing a ladder and pole jumping. 

Our team won the Most Innovative Design Award and secured overall 6th position at the National Round among 89 participating teams.

A presentation summarizing the problem statement, our design process and our eventual performance can be found here: <a href="/assets/documents/robocon_ppt.pdf">[Slides]</a>
